\section{Background on Stationary Vector Time Series}

The reader should have a basic familiarity with multivariate time
 series analysis, such as that provided by L\"utkepohl (2007).  
 Our focus is on discrete-time stochastic processes taking values in $\RR^n$,
 and such will be denoted $\{ X_t \}$, i.e., a vector time series.
   Each $X_t$ for  a particular   $t \in \ZZ$ is a random vector 
 with $n$ components, and 
 the $j$th component will be denoted $X_{t,j}$ for $1 \leq j \leq n$.
  This can also be written as $X_{t,j} = e_j^{\prime} \, X_t$, where
 $e_j$ is the $j$th unit vector in $\RR^n$.  The union of these
 unit vectors is the $n \times n$ identity matrix, denoted $1_n$.

 In this book we are focused upon square integrable random variables,
 so that the classic Hilbert space projection theory (see, for example,
 Brockwell and Davis (1991)) can be applied.   Occasionally, we consider 
  vector time series $\{ Y_t \}$ or $\{ Z_t \}$, in which case the 
 same conventions apply.When $\{ X_t \}$ is 
 weakly stationary, its autocovariance function (acf)
 is defined for $h \in \ZZ$  via 
\[
   \Gamma (h) = \mbox{Cov} [ X_{t+h}, X_t ],
\]
 which does not depend upon $t$ by the stationarity assumption.  Recall
 that $\Gamma (-h) = { \Gamma (h) }^{\prime}$, and clearly
\[
   \Gamma_{jk} (h) = \mbox{Cov} [ X_{t+h,j}, X_{t,k} ]
\]
 for $1 \leq j,k \leq n$. The spectral density is a complex matrix-valued
 function of $\omega \in [-\pi, \pi]$, defined as the 
 Fourier Transform (FT) of the acf:
\[
   F (\omega) = \sum_{h \in \ZZ} \Gamma (h) \, z^h,
\]
 where we use the shorthand $z = e^{-i \omega}$.  Clearly,
\[
    F(-\omega) = 
   \sum_{h \in \ZZ} \Gamma (h) \, z^{-h} 
   = \sum_{h \in \ZZ} \Gamma (-h) \, z^h = 
  \sum_{h \in \ZZ} { \Gamma (h) }^{\prime} \, z^h = { F (\omega) }^{\prime},
\]
 which shows that the spectral density function (sdf) is Hermitian.
  In addition, its eigenvalues (for each $\omega$) are real and non-negative.
  Given a bounded sdf (i.e., each $F_{jk} $ has bounded modulus as a function
 of $\omega$), the acf can be recovered via inverse FT:
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:spec2acf}
  \Gamma (h) = { \langle F  \rangle }_h
  =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} F(\omega) \, e^{i \omega h}
  \, d\omega,
\end{equation}
 which uses the bracket notation to define the average integral of a 
 function (of $\omega$) multiplied by $e^{i \omega h} = z^{-h}$.

 The lag operator on a time series is denoted $L$, and is defined via
 the action
\[
  L X_t = X_{t-1}.
\]
  Powers  of $L$ are defined analogously, with $L^0 = 1$ (an operator
 identity) and negative powers yielding forward time shifts, i.e., leads.
 Matrix polynomials of $L$ yield new operators that act upon a time series
 using the linearity principal.  Thus, if $A(L) = \sum_{j=0}^a A_j \, L^j$
 for $n \times n$ matrices $A_j$, then
\[
  A(L) \, X_t = \sum_{j=0}^a A_j \, X_{t-j}.
\] 
  For many applications in this book, the polynomials are actually scalar,
 and can be interpreted as having coefficients $A_j$ given by an  
 identity matrix $1_n$ multiplied by a scalar coefficient $a_j$.

 The spectral representation of a stationary square integrable vector 
time series is particularly useful.  Assuming that $\EE X_t = 0$ (the
 zero vector in $\RR^n$) so that no fixed effects are present, we describe
 the stochastic process via
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:specRep}
  X_t = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i \omega t} \, \mathcal{Z} (d\omega),
\end{equation}
 which is a stochastic integral computed with a Stieltjes measure
 $\mathcal{Z} (d\omega)$.  This is an orthogonal increments process,
 which mean $\mathcal{Z}$ is a random measure defined on ${[-\pi,\pi]}^n$
 that maps disjoint sets to independent random variables.  The actual
 distribution of the random measure is not our concern, but the particular
 orthogonal increments process associated with $\{ X_t \}$ has the 
 property that
\[
  \mbox{Cov} [ \mathcal{Z} (d\omega), \mathcal{Z} (d\xi) ]
   = {(2 \pi)}^{-1} \, F (\omega) \, d\omega \, 1_{ \{   \omega = \xi \} }
\]
 where $1_A$ is the indicator for the set $A$.
  (Also recall that for complex variables, a 
covariance involves conjugation of
 the second argument.)  This validates the expression
\[
  \mbox{Cov} [ X_{t+h}, X_t ] =
 \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}  \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i \omega (t+h)} \,
  e^{-i \xi t } \, \mbox{Cov} [ \mathcal{Z} (d\omega), 
  \mathcal{Z} (d\xi) ] 
 =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} F(\omega) \, e^{i \omega h}
  \, d\omega = \Gamma (h).
\]
 As an example -- that furnishes a basic building block for subsequent processes --
 we have {\em white noise}, which refers to a mean zero $\{ X_t \}$ where $F$ is constant, i.e.,
 $F(\omega) = \Sigma$ for all $\omega$, where $\Sigma $ is real and symmetric and
 non-negative definite.  Clearly, $\Gamma (h) = 0$ for $h \neq 0$ and $\Gamma (0) = \Sigma$.
 We denote this type of process with the notation $\mbox{WN} (\Sigma)$.

 The advantage of the spectral representation is that it quickly facillitates
 the understanding of linear filtering in the frequency domain.
 A multivariate filter maps one vector time series to another, and for
 now we suppose that both input and output belong to $\RR^n$.
 Linear filters can be expressed as matrix Laurent series in $L$:
\[
 \Psi (L) = \sum_{\ell \in \ZZ} \psi (\ell) \, L^{\ell},
\]
 where each $\psi (\ell)$ is an $n \times n$ matrix.  
 Individual entries of the matrix are denoted $\psi_{jk} (\ell)$,
 for $1 \leq j, k \leq n$.   We also use the notation
  $ {[\Psi (L) ]}^{s}_r $ to denote $\sum_{\ell=r}^s
  \psi (\ell) \, L^{\ell}$. In the special case that $\Psi (L)$ is a power
 series in $L$, the only nonzero coefficients are for $\ell \geq 0$, 
 so that no negative powers of $L$ are featured, i.e., the filter
 only utilizes present and past data.  Such a filter is called a 
 {\em concurrent} filter.  

 The action of   a linear  filter
 on a weakly stationary time series,
 expressed in terms of the spectral representation, is
\[
  Y_t = \Psi (L) \, X_t = \sum_{\ell \in \ZZ} \psi (\ell) \, X_{t-\ell}
   = \sum_{\ell \in \ZZ} \psi (\ell)
  \, \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i \omega (t-\ell)} \,
   \mathcal{Z} (d\omega) =
  \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i \omega t} \, \Psi (e^{-i \omega}) \,
   \mathcal{Z} (d\omega).
\]
 So the output time series $\{ Y_t \}$ has orthogonal increments process
  $\Psi (z) \, \mathcal{Z} (d\omega)$, and in particular its sdf is
\[  
   \Psi (z) \, F(\omega) \, { \Psi (z) }^{*},
\]
 where $*$ denotes the conjugate transpose.  Thus, it is very natural
 to analyze a filter in terms of the function $\Psi (e^{-i \omega})$,
 which is called the {\em frequency response function} (frf).  In 
 the scalar case, an frf can be further dissected via the polar 
 decomposition of a complex number, yielding its {\em gain function}
 (the modulus) and the {\em phase function} (its angular portion).  
  Note that the coefficients are recovered from the frf via the inverse FT:
\[
  \psi (\ell) = {\langle \Psi (e^{-i \cdot } ) \rangle }_{\ell}.
\]
  It is well-known from Fourier theory that the degree of smoothness of a
 function at $\omega = 0$ corresponds to the degree of decay in the coefficients 
 of its  inverse FT.  In particular, when the frf is smooth and flat in a
 neighborhood of the origin then the matrix norm of the 
 coefficients $\psi (\ell)$ decays rapidly as $|\ell| \tends \infty$.  Conversely,
 discontinuities in the frf indicates slowly decaying coefficients.

 Datasets are typically available as a finite set of contiguous regular
 measurements, denoted $\{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T \}$, where $T$ is 
 the length of sample.  The data is viewed as a realization of the 
 corresponding random vectors $\{ X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_T \}$, or alternatively
 as a time window of the sample path $\{ x_t \}$ corresponding to times
 $1, 2, \ldots, T$.  Applying the {\em vec} operator to such a sample
 yields the full vector $\underline{X}$, which is given by
\[
 \underline{X} = \mbox{vec} [ X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_T ].
\]
 The covariance matrix of this $nT$-dimensional random vector, in the
 stationary case, is block Toeplitz,   Each block is $n \times n$, and
 the $st$th such block, for $1 \leq s,t \leq T$, is given by $\Gamma (s-t)$.
 Also, from the sample we can compute the {\em Discrete Fourier Transform} (DFT)
  via
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dft-def}
    \widetilde{X} (\omega) = T^{-1/2} \, \sum_{t=1}^T z^t \, X_t.
\end{equation}
 This can be computed for any $\omega \in [-\pi, \pi]$, though if we restrict
 to Fourier frequencies -- of the form
 $2 \pi j/T$ for integer $j$ -- then the various real and imaginary 
components of the DFT will be asymptotically uncorrelated, and
 also asymptotically normal.   The multivariate {\em periodogram}
  is defined to   be the rank one Hermitian matrix
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:per-def}
  \widehat{F} (\omega) = \widetilde{X} (\omega) \, { \widetilde{X} (\omega) }^*.
\end{equation}
  The periodogram furnishes a basic estimate of the spectral density $F$ of the process.
  There is an empirical version of (\ref{eq:spec2acf}), where the periodogram is mapped to the sample 
 autocovariance:
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:per2acf}
  \widehat{\Gamma} (h) = { \langle \widehat{F}  \rangle }_h
  =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \widehat{F}(\omega) \, e^{i \omega h}
  \, d\omega.
\end{equation}
   This is easily verified using the definition of sample autocovariance
\[
   \widehat{\Gamma} (h) = T^{-1} \, \sum_{t=1}^{T-h}
   X_{t+h} \, X_t^{\prime}
\]
 for $h \geq 0$, and with $\widehat{\Gamma} (h) = { \widehat{\Gamma} (-h) }^{\prime}$ for $h < 0$.
  Conversely, the periodogram is the FT of the sample autocovariances:
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:acf2per}
   \widehat{F} (\omega) = \sum_{|h| < T} \widehat{\Gamma} (h) \, e^{-i   \omega h}.
\end{equation}

\section{MSE Optimal Prediction Problems}

\subsection{The Linear Prediction Problem} We define the class of
real-time estimation problems considered in this book.  This chapter
 focuses upon the case of weakly stationary vector time series, but
 Chapter \ref{int_sec} makes extensions to difference stationary processes.

\begin{Definition} \rm
 A {\bf target} is defined to be the output of any known linear
 filter acting on the data process, i.e.,  $\{Y_t \}$ is a target
 time series corresponding to a given filter $\Psi (L)$ acting on a 
given observed time series
 $\{ X_t \}$ if and only if we can write for all integers $t$
\[
 Y_t = \Psi (L) X_t.
\] 
 We say that $\{ Y_t \}$ is a {\bf scalar target} if $\Psi (L)$ is a
 $1 \times n$-dimensional filter.
\end{Definition}

We are only interested in scalar targets.  The reason is that if $\{ Y_t \}$
 is multivariate, we can treat each component series $\{ Y_{t,j} \}$ for
 $1 \leq j \leq n$ in turn, so that without loss of generality we
 can just give the treatment for the scalar case. 

\paragraph{Example 1: Multi-step Ahead Forecasting.}  
  Suppose that our goal is to forecast one of the component series 
 $h$ steps ahead, where $h \geq 1$ is the given {\em forecast lead}.
  Here, suppose that the series of interest is the first component, so 
 that 
\[
  Y_t = X_{t+h,1}
\]
  for all $ t \in \ZZ$.  This is indeed a scalar target, setting
  $\Psi (L) = L^{-h} \, e_1^{\prime}$.  That is, each $\psi (\ell)$
 is a $1 \times n$ row vector, each of which are zero except $\psi (-h)$,
 which is given by $e_1^{\prime}$.
 

\paragraph{Example 2: Ideal Low-Pass.} 
 In order to estimate a trend from a given series, conceptually we wish
 to screen out all the higher frequency components in the data.  With reference
 to the spectral representation, if $\Psi (z)$ is zero for all $\omega$ in a 
 band of the higher frequencies, then $\{ Y_t \}$ will only be composed of 
 low frequency stochastic sinusoids.  The simplest way to achieve such an output
 is to design the frf as an indicator function, involving 
  a steep cutoff of noise frequencies; see Baxter and King (1999).  This is
 viewed by some as the best possible definition of trend, and hence the filter is
 called the ideal low-pass.  For scalar target, we have
\[
  \Psi (z) = 1_{ [ -\mu, \mu ]} (\omega) \, e_1^{\prime}
\]
 for some cutoff $\mu \in (0, \pi)$ that separates the pass-band from
the stop-band.  To understand this terminology of pass-band and stop-band, observe
 that the spectral representation of the scalar target is
\[
  Y_t = \int_{ [-\mu, \mu]} e^{i \omega t} \, e_1^{\prime} 
  \mathcal{Z} (d\omega).
\]
  Here, the stochastic integration only includes frequencies in the pass-band 
 $[-\mu, \mu]$,  and all content belonging to the stop-band has been eliminated.
 The coefficients are given by 
\[ 
  \psi (\ell) = \frac{ \sin (\ell \mu) }{ \pi \ell } \, e_1^{\prime}
\]
 for $\ell \neq 0$ and $\psi (0) = \mu/\pi \, e_1^{\prime}$.   


\paragraph{Example 3: HP Low-pass.}  The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter (Hodrick
and Prescott, 1997) is a low-pass filter appropriate for producing trends.
 A multivariate version of the HP low-pass (or just HP), 
 associated with trend-irregular structural models,
 was proposed in McElroy and Trimbur (2015); the frf is given by
\[
   \Psi (z) = \Sigma_{\mu} \, { \left( \Sigma_{\mu} + {|1 - z|}^4 \, \Sigma_{\iota} 
	\right) }^{-1}
\]
 in the case that the matrices $\Sigma_{\mu}$ and $\Sigma_{\iota}$ have full rank.  
  When $\Sigma_{\mu}$ has reduced rank, an alternative expression is available,
 but note that the frf is a continuous matrix-valued function of $\omega$.
The matrices $\Sigma_{\mu}$ and $\Sigma_{\iota}$ have an interpretation in terms
 of the econometric concept of trend co-integration, which is further explored
 in Chapter REF???.  It is always assumed that $\Sigma_{\iota}$ has full rank, and hence 
 we can rewrite as
\[
  \Psi (z) = Q \, { \left( Q + {| 1 - z|}^4 \, 1_n \right) }^{-1}
\]
 with $Q = \Sigma_{\mu} \, \Sigma_{\iota}^{-1}$ representing a matrix
 {\em signal-to-noise ratio}, or snr.  This formula 
  generalizes the univariate HP filter, which has frf
\[
 \Psi (z) = \frac{ q}{ q + {| 1 - z|}^4 }
\]
 for snr parameter $q > 0$.  Small values of $q$ correspond to trends that are
 buried in volatile white noise, and thus require much smoothing to recover.
 The filter perfectly reflects this need, because a small $q$ indicates a steep
 drop in the frf (which takes value one at $\omega = 0$) as $\omega$ is increased
 from zero, and hence the filter coefficients decay slowly.  Conversely, higher values
 of $q$ -- corresponding to highly salient trends -- yield an frf that equals unity
 in a large neighborhood of the origin, with coefficients that decay swiftly,
 indicating that little smoothing is needed to discover the trend.  These observations
 carry over to the multivariate case, though we judge the size of the snr via a
 matrix norm (such as the maximum eigenvalue) of $Q$.  Some of these eigenvalues can be
 zero, corresponding to the case that $\Sigma_{\mu}$ has reduced rank -- this has the
 effect of generating trends that are collinear.  In the case of a scalar target,
 where we seek a trend for the first input series $\{ X_{t,1} \}$,  we have 
\[
  \Psi (z) = e_1^{\prime} \, Q \, { \left( Q + {| 1 - z|}^4 \, 1_n \right) }^{-1}.
\]
 There are no known analytical formulas for the coefficients in the multivariate case,
 although in the univariate case they are available in McElroy (2008).



\paragraph{Example 4: HP High-pass.}  While the HP filter is used to extract
 trends, the residual is thought to measure the business cycle along with
 higher frequency oscillations in the data.  Thus, taking the identity minus the
 HP low-pass yields the HP high-pass filter:
\[
  \Psi (z) =   { \left( Q + {| 1 - z|}^4 \, 1_n \right) }^{-1} \, {|1 - z|}^4.
\]
  The presence of the term ${|1 - z|}^4$ indicates differencing by the ${(1-L)}^2$
 and ${(1 - L^{-1})}^2$; thus the HP high-pass will annihilate cubic polynomials,
 and generally reduces high order stochastic trends to stationarity.  

\vspace{.5cm}

As we see from these examples, the targets of real-time signal 
 extraction  are features of the stochastic process that are of interest to 
 a particular user.  Some scalar targets depend upon only  a single component 
 of the time series (Examples 1 and 2), whereas others may be defined in
 terms of all the components (Examples 3 and 4).  However, these targets
 represent an ideal feature of the time series that typically we cannot compute
 in real-time.

 Real-time refers to time present, wherein we have access to present and past 
 information, but have great uncertainty about the future.  This is an 
 essential feature of human existence.  Time series methodology provides tools
 to model and understand the flow of information from past to present to future,
 with the implicit viewpoint that whereas causality is to some degree present --
 past events have  a causative impact on future events, but not vice versa --
 there are other facets governing present and future outcomes that are not 
 traceable to a particular variable's past.  In other words, knowing the past
 values of a component time series $\{ X_{t,1} \}$ is not sufficient to flawlessly
 determine its future values.  However, having other explanatory variables in play
 can reduce the uncertainty of the future; taking $n$ higher, we may be able
 to reduce the errors in forecasts.  

 The concept of {\em Granger causality} can be used to parse these notions mathematically.
 We may consider other component series $\{ X_{t,j} \}$ for $j \geq 2$ useful
 for determining the future of $\{ X_{t,1} \}$ if the one-step ahead forecast
 mean square error (MSE) is reduced, in which case we say that Granger causality
 is present.  In such a scenario it can be proved that the one-step ahead forecast
 MSE arising from utilizing $\{ X_{t,1} \}$ alone is greater than that obtained
 using the additional series.  Hence, there is benefit to increasing $n$ with 
 additional ancillary series so long as they are helpful for forecasting.  For real-time
 estimation problems, we seek to determine the best possible estimates of a
 target given a relevant collection of ancillary series.

More formally, the real-time estimation problem is concerned with
projecting the target $Y_t$ onto the available data $X_{t:} = \{ X_t, X_{t-1},
\ldots \}$, i.e., the semi-infinite past.  This formulation presumes that
 we have access to relevant ancillary series, and that we have access to all
 present and past values.  In practice, databases only extend back a few decades,
 and the infinitely remote past represents merely an idyll useful for 
 mathematical simplicity.  The linear estimation problem seeks a linear estimate
  of the form
\[
   \widehat{Y}_t = \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \widehat{\psi} (\ell) \, X_{t-\ell}
     = \widehat{\Psi} (L) \, X_t,
\]
 which shows that we seek a linear
(time-invariant) concurrent filter $\widehat{\Psi} (L)$, applied to $\{ X_t \}$. 
 We desire that the
error in approximating the target with the available data be small with respect to MSE.
 If $\{ X_t \}$ were Gaussian, we could view our estimate as the conditional
expectation $\widehat{Y}_t = \EE [ Y_t \vert X_{t : } ]$, with the coefficients
$\{ \widehat{\psi} (\ell) \}$ selected to minimize the MSE
  of the approximation error $Y_t - \widehat{Y}_t$.  However, in our treatment in this book
 we do not presume Gaussian structure, and are not concerned with conditional expectations
 {\em per se}; rather, we seek linear solutions with minimal MSE.  
 

\begin{Definition} \rm
 The {\bf Linear Prediction Problem} (LPP) seeks the minimal
 MSE linear estimate that solves the real-time estimation problem
  arising from a scalar target.  That
 is, the LPP involves determining causal $\widehat{\Psi} (L)$ such that the
 prediction error
\[
 Y_t - \widehat{Y}_t = \left[ \Psi (L) - \widehat{\Psi} (L) \right] \, X_t
\]
 has mean zero and minimal MSE.
\end{Definition}

\paragraph{Example 1: Multi-step Ahead Forecasting.}   The LPP corresponds to
  optimal $h$-step
 forecasting, and the forecast error is $[L^{-h} \, e_1^{\prime} - \widehat{\Psi} (L) ] \, X_t$.
  Note that although $\Psi (L)$ only involves one component series $\{ X_{t,1} \}$,
  the real-time concurrent filter $\widehat{\Psi} (L)$ can involve all $n$ component series.

\paragraph{Example 3: HP Low-pass.}  
  The LPP attempts to determine an optimal real-time trend estimate, where the target trend
 -- sometimes called the historical trend -- is defined through the HP low-pass filter.
  Here, both the target filter $\Psi (L)$ and the real-time 
   concurrent filter $\widehat{\Psi} (L)$   involve all $n$ component series.


\subsection{Solution to the Linear Prediction Problem}

 When the data process is itself causal and linear, it is possible
 to give an explicit solution to the LPP in terms of the Wold
 decomposition (Brockwell and Davis, 1991).
  All purely nondeterministic weakly stationary (mean zero) processes
 have a Wold decomposition $X_t = \Theta (L) \epsilon_t$, where $\{
 \epsilon_t \}$ is $\mbox{WN} (\Sigma)$ and $\Theta (L) =
 \sum_{\ell \in \ZZ} \theta (\ell) \, L^{\ell}$.
 When $\theta (\ell) = 0 $ for all $\ell < 0 $, the process is called {\em causal}.
 First, the error in the LPP is denoted $E_t = Y_t - \widehat{Y}_t$, which is
 clearly mean zero  and covariance  stationary, in fact having spectral representation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dfa-error}
  E_t = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i \omega t } \, 
   \left[ \Psi (z) - \widehat{\Psi} (z) \right] \, \mathcal{Z} (d\omega).
\end{equation}
  With these preliminaries, we can state the solution to the LPP.

\begin{Proposition}
 \label{prop:GPP}
 Suppose that $\{ X_t \}$ is mean zero and weakly stationary 
 with spectral representation (\ref{eq:specRep}), and moreover is
 causal, expressed as $X_t = \Theta (L) \, \epsilon_t$.    Then the solution
 to the LPP posed by a scalar target $Y_t = \Psi (L) \, X_t$ is given by
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:GPPsoln}
 \widehat{\Psi} (L) = \sum_{\ell \geq 0 } \psi (\ell) \, L^{\ell} + \sum_{\ell < 0 } \psi (\ell)
 \,  { [ \Theta (L) ]}_{-\ell}^{ \infty  } \, L^{\ell} \, {\Theta (L) }^{-1}.
\end{equation}
 Moreover, the minimal MSE is given by
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:minimalMSE}
 \frac{1}{ 2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}   \sum_{\ell > 0 } \psi (-\ell) \,
 z^{-\ell} {[ \Theta  (z) ]}_0^{\ell-1}   \,  \Sigma \,
  { {[ \Theta  (z) ]}_0^{ \ell-1} }^*  \,
   \sum_{\ell > 0 } \psi (-\ell) \,  z^{\ell}  \, d\omega.
\end{equation}
 \end{Proposition}

\paragraph{Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:GPP}.}
 In order for a linear solution to be MSE optimal, it is sufficient that the
 resulting error process be uncorrelated with the data $X_{t:}$.
   If we can show that the real-time signal extraction error process $\{ E_t \}$
  depends only on future innovations, then by the causality of $\{ X_t \}$ the error process 
  must be uncorrelated   with $X_{t:}$, establishing optimality.  
 The filter error of the putative solution is  
  given by
\begin{align*}
 \Psi (L) - \widehat{\Psi} (L) & = \sum_{\ell < 0 } \psi (\ell) \, L^{\ell} \,
   \left( 1 -   {[ \Theta (L) ]}_{-\ell}^{\infty} \, { \Theta (L) }^{-1} \right) \\
  & =  \sum_{\ell < 0 } \psi (\ell) \, L^{\ell} \, 
  {[ \Theta (L) ]}_{0}^{ -(\ell + 1)} \, { \Theta (L) }^{-1}.
\end{align*}
 Applying this to $\{ X_t \}$ yields
\[
  E_t = \sum_{\ell =1 }^{\infty} \psi (-\ell) \, {[ \Theta (L) ]}_0^{\ell - 1} \, 
   \epsilon_{t + \ell }.
\]
  Noting that ${[ \Theta (L) ]}_0^{\ell - 1}$ is an order $\ell-1$ polynomial in $L$,
 and is applied to $\epsilon_{t+ \ell}$, it is apparent that $E_t$ is a linear function
 of future innovations $\{ \epsilon_{t+1}, \epsilon_{t+2}, \ldots \}$.  Computing
 the variance of $E_t$ yields the expression for the minimal MSE.  $\quad \Box$


\begin{Remark} \rm  
\label{rem:GPPsoln}
 The formula (\ref{eq:minimalMSE}) gives us a lower
 bound  on the MSE when we use sub-optimal proxies for $\widehat{\Psi} (L)$.
\end{Remark}

 As indicated by Remark \ref{rem:GPPsoln}, the result of Proposition \ref{prop:GPP}
 is chiefly useful when we know $\Theta (L)$.  However, this is rarely the case in 
 practice: a classical parametric approach involves formulating a time series model, fitted 
 using the Gaussian likelihood, and finally computing the LPP solution in terms of
 the fitted model.  Alternatively, one might consider fitting a specified model such that
 the LPP MSE is minimized.  A more broad nonparametric approach involves 
 considering classes of concurrent filters and directly minimizing the LPP MSE over
 this class -- this is the methodology of Direct Filter Analysis (DFA).


\paragraph{Illustration 1:  VAR(1).}  Consider an LPP where the true process $\{ X_t \}$
 is a Vector Autoregression (VAR) of order 1.  This process can be described via
\[
  X_t = \Phi \, X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t
\]
 for a matrix $\Phi$ with all eigenvalues bounded by one in modulus (L\"utkepohl, 2007).  It is known
 that the VAR(1) has the causal representation  $\Theta (L) = {(1 - \Phi \, L )}^{-1}$.  Because
 for $\ell < 0$ 
\[
   { [ \Theta (L) ]}_{-\ell}^{ \infty  } = \sum_{j = -\ell}^{\infty} \Phi^j \, L^j 
  = \Phi^{-\ell} \, L^{-\ell} \, {( 1 - \Phi \, L )}^{-1},
\]
 we find that (\ref{eq:GPPsoln}) reduces to
\[
  \widehat{\Psi} (L) =   \sum_{\ell \geq 0 } \psi (\ell) \, L^{\ell} +
	\sum_{\ell < 0} \psi (\ell) \, \Phi^{-\ell}.
\]
  The second term in this expression we denote by $A_{\Psi} (\Phi)$.  Hence, the optimal
 concurrent filter is determined by applying the filter to past data and modifying the
 present weight $\psi (0)$ by adding the quantity $A_{\Psi} (\Phi)$.  In the case of
 $h$-step ahead forecasting of the first time series (Example 1), $\widehat{\Psi} (L)
 = A_{\Psi} (\Phi) = e_1^{\prime} \, \Phi^h$.



\section{Model Fitting via LPP MSE Minimization}
%\label{gppmf}

 Here we study the mechanics of fitting a parametric model such that the LPP MSE
 is minimized.  In the case of the one-step ahead forecasting MSE, this is related
 to Whittle estimation of vector time series models (c.f.,  Taniguchi and Kakizawa (2000)).
  We will focus on the class of separable causal linear models, wherein the innovation variance
 $\Sigma$ is governed by a separate set of parameters from those describing the power
 series $\Theta (L)$.  The model is essentially described through a particular class of
 power series   $\Theta_{\vartheta} (L)$, parameterized by a vector $\vartheta $
  belonging to some model  parameter manifold.    Hence the model sdf is
\[
  F_{\vartheta} (\omega) = \Theta_{\vartheta} (z) \, \Sigma \,  { \Theta_{\vartheta} (z) }^*.
\]
 However, the model may be misspecified: the process' sdf is denoted $\widetilde{F}$, 
  and may not
 belong to the model class.  The goal of model fitting is to determine $\vartheta$ 
  such that
 $F_{\vartheta}$ is a good approximation to $\widetilde{F}$.  
 Clearly, knowing $\vartheta$ does not
 fully determine $F_{\vartheta}$ because $\Sigma$ remains unknown; however, the methods
 described below provide for estimates of $\Sigma$ in terms of $\vartheta$ and the process.
 From the proof of Proposition \ref{prop:GPP} we know that the filter error satisfies
\[
  E_t = \sum_{\ell =1 }^{\infty} \psi (-\ell) \, L^{-\ell} \,  {[ \Theta (L) ]}_0^{\ell - 1} \, 
   { \Theta_{\vartheta} (L) }^{-1} \, X_t.
\] 
 In other words, we have an error filter $ \Xi_{\vartheta} (L) \,  
  { \Theta_{\vartheta} (L) }^{-1}  $,
 where
\[
  \Xi_{\vartheta} (L)  = \sum_{\ell =1 }^{\infty} \psi (-\ell) \,  L^{-\ell} \,
   {[ \Theta (L) ]}_0^{\ell - 1},
\]
  such that for any choice of $\vartheta $ we can compute filter errors $\{ E_t \}$.
 Note that these are not in general to be interpreted as residuals, and they need not be white noise.
  But we can seek to minimize their variance.  In practice,
 the calculation of such filter errors  may require a truncation of the error filter, because the finite
 sample $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_T$ is available, not the entire infinite past.  The error filter is
 $1 \times n$, and for any $\vartheta $ and any Hermitian function $G$ we can compute
\begin{align*}
  J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, G) & 	= \frac{1}{2 \pi} \, \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \Xi (z) \,
  { \Theta_{\vartheta} (z) }^{-1} \, G(\omega)
  \,  {{ \Theta_{\vartheta} (z) }^{-1} }^* \, { \Xi (z) }^* \, d\omega  = \mbox{tr} \{ 
 { \langle G \, K_{\vartheta} \rangle }_0 \} \\
   K_{\vartheta} (z) & =  {{ \Theta_{\vartheta} (z) }^{-1} }^* \, { \Xi (z) }^* \,  \Xi (z) \, 
 { \Theta_{\vartheta} (z) }^{-1}.
\end{align*}
 Then $\mbox{Var} [ E_t ] = J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widetilde{F})$.  As we seek to minimize the variability in the filter errors,
 we can take $J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widetilde{F})$ as our criterion function.  However, this will only
 determine the proximity of the model to the true sdf, which is unavailable to us -- in order to compute actual
 parameter estimates, we must utilize the data to approximate the true sdf. 
 There are basic results giving asymptotic normality for simple functionals of the periodogram,
 and therefore this crude  estimator of the true sdf is sufficient for our purposes.  We propose 
$J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widehat{F})$ as
 an estimator of $J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widetilde{F})$, and intend that the respective minimizers have the same relationship.
 Namely, if $\vartheta (\widetilde{F}) $ is the unique minimizer of 
 $J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widetilde{F}) $ and
  $\vartheta (\widehat{F}) $ is the unique minimizer of $J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widehat{F}) $, then
 $\vartheta (\widehat{F})$ is an estimator of $\vartheta (\widetilde{F})$, which is called the {\em pseudo-true value} (PTV).
  From the PTV and estimator, we can also compute the innovation covariance matrix by the formulas
\begin{align*}
  \Sigma (\widetilde{F}) & = { \langle { \Theta_{\vartheta (\widetilde{F} ) } (z) }^{-1} \,
   \widetilde{F} \, 
 { { \Theta_{\vartheta(\widetilde{F}) } (z) }^{-1} }^*
	\rangle }_0 \\
    \Sigma (\widehat{F}) & = { \langle { \Theta_{\vartheta (\widehat{F} ) } (z) }^{-1} \, \widehat{F} \, 
{ { \Theta_{\vartheta(\widehat{F}) } (z) }^{-1} }^*
	\rangle }_0.
\end{align*}
 In the special case that the model is correctly specified, there exists some 
$\widetilde{\vartheta}$ and $\widetilde{\Sigma}$ such that
 $\widetilde{F} (\omega) = \Theta_{\widetilde{\vartheta}} (z) \, \widetilde{\Sigma} \, 
{\Theta_{\widetilde{\vartheta}} (z)  }^*$; it is shown below
  that the PTV matches the truth.
 
\begin{Proposition}
 \label{prop:PTV-truth}
 Given an LPP $\Psi$ and the criterion function $J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widetilde{F})$, if the model is correctly specified and the 
 minimizer $\vartheta (\widetilde{F})$ is unique then it equals the true parameter 
$\widetilde{\vartheta}$, and $\Sigma (\widetilde{F}) = \widetilde{\Sigma}$.
\end{Proposition}

\paragraph{Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:PTV-truth}.}
 Because the model is correct, the criterion function becomes
\[
  J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widetilde{F}) = { \langle \Xi (z) \, { \Theta_{\vartheta   } (z) }^{-1} \, 
   \Theta_{\widetilde{\vartheta}} (z) \, \widetilde{\Sigma} \, 
  {\Theta_{\widetilde{\vartheta}} (z)  }^* \, { { \Theta_{\vartheta  } (z) }^{-1} }^*
 \, { \Xi (z) }^* \rangle }_0,
\]
 which for $\vartheta = \widetilde{\vartheta}$ achieves the minimal value:
\[
  J_{\Psi} (\widetilde{\vartheta}, \widetilde{F})  ={ \langle \Xi (z) \,   \widetilde{\Sigma} \, 
   { \Xi (z) }^* \rangle }_0.
\]
  Because the minimizer is unique by assumption, $\vartheta (\widetilde{F}) = \widetilde{\vartheta} $. 
  Plugging this into the formula
 for $\Sigma (\widetilde{F})$, we see that it equals $\widetilde{\Sigma}$.  $\quad \Box$

\paragraph{Example 1: Multi-step Ahead Forecasting.}   For $h$-step ahead forecasting, only $\psi (-h)$
  is nonzero, so that
 $\Xi (L) =  L^{-h} \,  e_1^{\prime} \, {[ \Theta (L) ]}_0^{ h - 1}$. 
  Hence, the criterion function $J_{\Psi} $ fits models so as to minimize
 (in the frequency domain)  $h$-step ahead forecast error of the first series. 
 In the special case that $h=1$, the criterion function is
\[
 J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, G) =  e_1^{\prime} \, { \langle   { \Theta_{\vartheta   } (z) }^{-1}  \,
  G \, { { \Theta_{\vartheta  } (z) }^{-1} }^*  \rangle }_0 \, e_1.
\]
   If we were to compute such a measure for all $n$ series, and sum over the $n$ criteria, we would obtain the concentrated Whittle 
 likelihood, namely
\[
  \mbox{tr} \, \{  { \langle   { \Theta_{\vartheta   } (z) }^{-1}  \, G \,
  { { \Theta_{\vartheta  } (z) }^{-1} }^*  \rangle }_0 \}.
\]
  See the discussion in McElroy and Findley (2015).  This connection justifies viewing $J_{\Psi}$ as a generalization of the Whittle
 likelihood from one-step ahead forecasting to more general real-time LPPs.

It is possible to conduct inference from the PTVs on the basis of the estimates 
$\vartheta (\widehat{F})$, and thereby assess model fit.  
 In order to formulate our result, we assume that the PTVs are not on the
 boundary of the parameter set (otherwise the limit theory
 is non-standard; c.f., Self and Liang (1987)), and  that they are unique. 
We also assume that the  Hessian  $H(\vartheta) = \nabla \nabla^{\prime}
  J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widetilde{F}) $  of $J_{\Psi} $ is positive definite at the PTV.
  The so-called Hosoya-Taniguchi (HT) conditions of Hosoya and Taniguchi (1982) 
impose sufficient regularity   on the process
 $\{ X_t \}$ for our purposes; these conditions require that $\{ X_t \}$ is a 
causal filter of a higher-order martingale difference.  
 A simpler limiting variance expression is available if the fourth order cumulant
 function of $\{ X_t \}$ is zero.  

\begin{Theorem}
\label{thm:LPP-Clt}
 Suppose that $\vartheta (\widetilde{F}) $ exists uniquely in the interior of the model 
 parameter space,   and that $H(\vartheta (\widetilde{F}))$ is 
 positive definite.  Suppose that $\{ X_t \}$ has finite fourth moments, conditions (HT1)-(HT6) of Taniguchi and Kakizawa (2000, pp.55-56)
 hold, and that the fourth order cumulant function of $\{ X_t \}$ is zero.  Then the estimator is consistent for the PTV, and
\[
 \sqrt{T} \, \left( \vartheta( \widehat{F} ) - \vartheta (\widetilde{F}) \right) 
 \convinlaw \mathcal{N} \left( 0, { H(\vartheta (\widetilde{F})) }^{-1} \, V (\vartheta (\widetilde{F})) \, { H(\vartheta (\widetilde{F})) }^{-1} \right)
\]
 as $T \tends \infty$, where 
\[
  V_{jk} (\vartheta) =  \mbox{tr} \{ { \langle  \partial_j K_{\vartheta} (z) \, \widetilde{F} \, \partial_k K_{\vartheta} (z) \, \widetilde{F} \rangle }_0 \}.
\]
\end{Theorem}

\paragraph{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:LPP-Clt}.}
 A Taylor series exapansion of the gradient of $J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widehat{F})$ and $J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widetilde{F})$ yields the 
 asymptotic expression
\[
  \sqrt{T} \, \left( \vartheta( \widehat{F} ) - \vartheta (\widetilde{F}) \right)  = o_P (1) 
   - { H (\vartheta( \widetilde{F} )) }^{-1} \,  \mbox{tr} \, \{  {  \langle (\widehat{F} - \widetilde{F}) \, \nabla K_{\vartheta} \rangle }_0 \},
\]
 where the trace operator acts upon the spectral matrices, for each component of the gradient operator.  Our assumptions allow
 us to apply Lemma 3.1.1 of Taniguchi and Kakizawa (2000) to the right hand expression, yielding the stated central limit theorem.

\paragraph{Illustration 1: VAR(1).}  When the model is a VAR(1), the parameter vector $\vartheta$
 describes the entries of $\Phi$ in such a way that the matrix is stable (i.e., all eigenvalues
 have magnitude less than one).  The error filter can be 
 expressed
\begin{align*}
    \Xi (L) & =   \sum_{\ell =1 }^{\infty} \psi (-\ell) \,  L^{-\ell} \,
   \sum_{k=0}^{\ell-1} \Phi^k \, L^k \\
  & =  \sum_{\ell =1 }^{\infty} \psi (-\ell) \,  L^{-\ell} \,
   \left( 1 - \Phi^{\ell} \, L^{\ell} \right) \, {( 1 - \Phi \, L )}^{-1} \\
 & =  \left( \sum_{\ell =1 }^{\infty} \psi (-\ell) \,  L^{-\ell} -
    A_{\Psi} (\Phi) \right)  
    \, {( 1 - \Phi \, L )}^{-1}.
\end{align*}
  It follows that 
\begin{align*}
 J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, G) & = \sum_{\ell,k > 0} \psi (-\ell) \, {\langle G \rangle}_{\ell-k} \, 
	{\psi (-k)}^{\prime} - A_{\Psi} (\Phi) \, \sum_{k > 0} {\langle G \rangle}_{-k} 
	\, {\psi (-k)}^{\prime}  \\
  & - \sum_{\ell > 0} \psi (-\ell) \, { \langle G \rangle }_{\ell} \, 
	{ A_{\Psi} (\Phi) }^{\prime} + { A_{\Psi} (\Phi) }^{} \, { \langle G \rangle }_0 \,
 { A_{\Psi} (\Phi) }^{\prime},
\end{align*}
 which is easily computed.  Optimization with respect to $\vartheta$ is straightforward.
 In the special case of $h$-step ahead forecasting, the criterion further simplifies to
\begin{align*}
  J_{ L^{-h}} (\vartheta, G) & = 
  e_1^{\prime} \, { \langle G \rangle }_0 \, e_1 - e_1^{\prime} \, \Phi^h \, { \langle G \rangle}_{-h} 
	\, e_1 \\
 & - e_1^{\prime} \, {\langle G \rangle }_h \, {\Phi}^{h \prime} \, e_1
	+ e_1^{\prime} \, \Phi^h \, { \langle G \rangle }_0 \, {\Phi}^{h \prime} \, e_1,
\end{align*}
 and any $\vartheta$ such that
\[
  e_1^{\prime} \, \Phi^h = e_1^{\prime} \, { \langle G \rangle }_h \, { \langle G \rangle }_0^{-1}
\]
 is a critical point.  If the model is correctly specified, then setting $G$ equal to the spectral
 density of the VAR(1) yields a minimal possible MSE of
\[
   e_1^{\prime} \, \left( \Gamma (0) - \Phi^h \, \Gamma (0) \, {\Phi}^{h \prime} \right) \, e_1.
\]
 It is known that Whittle estimation corresponds to the $h=1$ case, with a criterion function given
 by the determinant of the forecast MSE matrix (McElroy and Findley, 2015), and in essence
 incorporates forecast error from all $n$ series.  In the above, the criterion only depends on the
 performance of the first series, which allows a practitioner to focus on parameter values
 that sacrifice performance on the other $n-1$ series in order to achieve superior results for
 the first series.

\paragraph{Exercise 1: Correct VAR(1) LPP.}  Simulate a sample of size $T=100$ from a
  bivariate VAR(1) process with 
\[
  \Phi = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & .5 \\ -.2 & .3 \end{array} \right]
\]
 and $\Sigma$ equal to the identity.  The eigenvalues are $.8$ and $.5$.
 Then utilize the LPP criterion $J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, G)$ to fit a VAR(1) model (let
 $\vartheta$ correspond to the four entries of $\Phi$) with both the $2$-step
 ahead forecasting LPP (Example 1) and the ideal low-pass LPP (Example 2) with 
  $\mu = \pi/24$, where $G$ is given by the periodogram of the sample.
  Do the parameter estimates appear to be consistent?  Repeat for $T=200$ and $T=500$.

\paragraph{Exercise 2: Incorrect VAR(1) LPP.}  Simulate a sample of size $T=100$ from
 a bivariate Vector Moving Avergage process of order one, or VMA(1), given by
\[
  X_t = \epsilon_t + \Theta \, \epsilon_{t-1},
\]
  where
\[
 \Theta = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & 0 \\ .4 & 2 \end{array} \right]
\]
  and $\Sigma$ equals the identity.  Use the VAR(1) LPP criterion of Exercise 1 to 
 fit the mis-specified VAR(1) to this process, for both the $2$-step ahead forecasting
 LPP and the ideal low-pass LPP.  Why do the parameter estimates not match those
 of $\Theta$?  Repeat for $T=200$ and $T=500$, and explain your results.
