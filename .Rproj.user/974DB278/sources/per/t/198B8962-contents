Chapter \ref{lpp_chap} introduced the LPP and its ideal solution.  This chapter
 extends the discussion, by determining optimal solutions without restricting
 to parametric models.

\section{Background on Multivariate Filtering}

 Recall the spectral representation of $\{ X_t \}$ via (\ref{eq:specRep}).  Because 
 there are $n$ series in the orthogonal increments process $\mathcal{Z}$, we have
\[
  X_{t,j} = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i \omega t} \, \mathcal{Z}_j (d\omega )
\] 
 for each $1 \leq j \leq n$, and hence for a scalar target $\{ Y_t \}$ we have
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:spec-rep.partial}
  Y_t = \sum_{j=1}^n  \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i \omega  t} \, \Psi_{1 j} (e^{-i \omega }) \,
   \mathcal{Z}_j (d\omega ).
\end{equation}
  Each of the functions $\Psi_{1j} (e^{-i \omega })$ is complex scalar-valued, and
 can be decomposed in terms of its gain and phase functions.   We here provide some
 background on these functions, because they provide an interpretation of the action
 of the linear filter on the input time series.

Any complex number $\zeta$ is decomposed in terms of its real $\Re \zeta$ and imaginary
 $\Im \zeta$ parts:
\[
 \zeta = \Re \zeta + i \, \Im \zeta.
\]
 The {\em magnitude} of $\zeta$ is defined via 
\[
  | \zeta | = \sqrt{ { \Re \zeta }^2 + { \Im \zeta }^2 }.
\]
 If this is positive, then $\zeta / |\zeta|$ is a complex number with unit modulus,
 and hence can be represented as $\exp \{ -i \, \mbox{Arg} \zeta \}$ for some angle
  in $[0, 2 \pi]$ known as $\mbox{Arg} \zeta$, or the {\em angular portion} or $\zeta$.
  It follows that
\[
  \zeta = | \zeta | \, \exp \{ -i \, \mbox{Arg} \zeta \},
\]
 which is known as the Polar decomposition of $\zeta$.  Sometimes it is of interest
 to use a negative Polar decomposition based upon the negative magnitude, which can
 still be written in terms of $\mbox{Arg} \zeta$ via
\[
  \zeta = - | \zeta| \, \exp \{ -i \, [ \pi +  \mbox{Arg} \zeta ] \},
\]
 using $e^{-i \pi} = -1$.  The angular portion of $\zeta$ can be directly computed
 from the real and imaginary parts of $\zeta$ via
\[
 \mbox{Arg} \zeta = \arctan \left( \frac{ -\Im \zeta }{ \Re \zeta} \right).
\]
 Now when $\zeta$ is a function of $\omega  \in [-\pi, \pi]$, then the magnitude and
 angular portions also become functions of $\omega $.   In particular, a scalar frequency 
 response function has a magnitude function (called the gain function) and 
 angular function (called the phase function).  In the case of some scalar filter 
 $\Psi (B)$ (e.g., the component filter $\Psi_{1j} (B)$) we obtain
\[
  \Psi  (e^{-i \omega }) = | \Psi  (e^{-i \omega })| \, 
   \exp \{ - i \, \mbox{Arg} \Psi (e^{-i \omega }) \}.
\]
  At $\omega  = 0$, we know the frequency response function is $\Psi (1) =
 \sum_{\ell \in \ZZ} \psi (\ell)$, which is real; hence the phase function at 
 $\omega  = 0$ must be an integer multiple of $\pi$.  It is advantageous to ensure
 the phase function takes the value zero, as this will facilitate the definition of
 the phase delay function discussed below.  We can ensure this condition by allowing
 the gain function to be signed.  Denoting these by $A(\omega )$ (for amplitude, or 
 signed gain) and $\Phi (\omega )$ (for continuous phase), we have
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:frf-gain.and.phase}
  \Psi (e^{-i \omega }) = A(\omega ) \, \exp \{ - i \, \Phi (\omega ) \}.
\end{equation}
  There may be frequencies $\omega $ for which the frf equals zero; because the real
 and imaginary parts of zero are both zero, there is an indeterminancy to the
 angular portion.  However, because the frf is continuous in $\omega $ (which follows
 from summability of the coefficients) we should define the phase function at 
 the zeroes such that it is continuous.  By adjusting the angular portion by
 an integer multiple of $\pi$, we can ensure that it will be a continuous function of
 $\omega $; this adjustment can be compensated by inserting a sign change in the gain 
 function.  In this way, the signed gain and continuous phase functions can be
 computed: both $A$ and $\Phi$ will be continuous functions of $\omega $, and $\Phi (0) = 0$
 as well.    Substituting (\ref{eq:frf-gain.and.phase})
  into the spectral representation (\ref{eq:spec-rep.partial})
 of the target, where $A_j$ and $\Phi_j$ are the gain and phase functions of $\Psi_{1j} 
  (e^{-i \omega })$,  yields
\[
  Y_t = \sum_{j=1}^n  \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i \omega  \, [ t - \omega {-1} \,
   \Phi_j (\omega )   ] } \,
  A_j ( \omega ) \,    \mathcal{Z}_j (d\omega ).
\]
 This representation is interpreted as follows: the target is the sum of $n$ filtered
 series, where each orthogonal increments process $\mathcal{Z}_j$ has been dilated
 by the signed gain function $A_j$, and the timing of the sinusoidal component 
 $e^{i \omega  t }$ has been delayed by $\omega ^{-1} \, \Phi_j (\omega )$.  
  This quantity, called the {\em phase delay function},
  is well-defined in a neighborhood of zero, as seen in the following
 result.

\begin{Proposition}
 \label{prop:phase-delay}
  If the scalar filter $\Psi (B)$ satisfies $\sum_{\ell \in \ZZ} \ell \, \psi (\ell) < \infty$
 and the phase function is continuously defined, then the phase delay function
\[
  \phi (\omega ) = \frac{\Phi (\omega ) }{ \omega }
\]
 is well-defined for $\omega  \in [-\pi, \pi]$, and 
\[
 \phi (0) = \dot{\Phi} (0) = \frac{ \sum_{\ell \in \ZZ} \ell \, \psi (\ell) }{ 
  \sum_{\ell \in \ZZ}   \psi (\ell) }.
\]
\end{Proposition}

\paragraph{Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:phase-delay}.}
 First note that the signed gain function is even, and hence $\dot{A} (0) = 0$.
 Differentiating (\ref{eq:frf-gain.and.phase}) and evaluating at zero yields
\[
  -i \, \sum_{\ell \in \ZZ} \ell \, \psi (\ell) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \omega }
  \Psi (e^{-i \omega }) \vert_{\omega = 0}
  = \dot{A} (0) \, e^{-i \, \Phi (0) } + A(0) \, e^{-i \, \Phi (0) } \,
  (-i \, \dot{\Phi} (0)).
\]
  Using $\dot{A} (0) = 0$, $\Phi (0) = 0$, and $A(0) = \Psi (1)$ yields
\[
 \dot{\Phi} (0) = \frac{ \sum_{\ell \in \ZZ} \ell \, \psi (\ell) }{ 
  \sum_{\ell \in \ZZ}   \psi (\ell) }.  \quad \Box
\]

\vspace{.5cm}

The amplitude effects can be understood as dilations of the input spectral densities.  
 If the spectral density matrix of the input process is denoted $F$, then $F_{jj}$
 is the spectral density of the $j$th component input series; its contribution to
 the target output involves the increment
\[
 A_j ( \omega ) \,    \mathcal{Z}_j (d\omega),
\]
 and the associated spectral density is
\[
  {| A_j (\omega) |}^2 \, F_{jj} (\omega).
\]
 There are approximate empirical versions of these relations, which can be described in  
 terms of the DFT.  Applying the definition (\ref{eq:dft-def}) to the scalar output $\{ Y_t \}$,
  and utilizing (\ref{eq:spec-rep.partial}), we obtain
\[
  \widetilde{Y} (\xi) = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} T^{-1/2} \, \sum_{t=1}^T e^{i (\omega - \xi) t}
 \, \Psi (e^{-i \omega}) \, \mathcal{Z} (d\omega).
\]
  Note that the summation is bounded as $T \tends \infty$ unless $\omega = \xi$; it can be shown
 that the variance of the difference between $\widetilde{Y} (\xi)$ and 
 $\Psi(e^{-i \xi}) \, \widetilde{X} (\xi)$ tends to zero, so that we have the approximate result
\begin{equation}
\label{convolution-dft}
  \widetilde{Y} (\omega) \approx \Psi(e^{-i \omega}) \, \widetilde{X} (\omega).
\end{equation}
  Utilizing (\ref{eq:per-def}), we obtain an approximate relation of periodograms:
\begin{equation}
 \label{convolution-per}
  \widehat{F}_Y (\omega) \approx  \Psi(e^{-i \omega}) \, \widehat{F}_X (\omega) \, 
  {   \Psi(e^{i \omega})  }^{\prime}.
\end{equation}
  
  



\section{Multivariate Direct Filter Analysis of the LPP}

 We can now discuss a more general solution to the LPP.
 One perspective on  Proposition \ref{prop:GPP} is that it provides a
 particular class of concurrent filters that arise from  specified models.  
  However, so long as these models are mis-specified, the resulting
 concurrent filters will be sub-optimal.  Therefore, it may be possible
  to improve performance by  utilizing broader classes of concurrent filters
 that are not derived from a particular model.    
 The Direct Filter Analysis (DFA) seeks a concurrent filter 
 $\widehat{\Psi} (B)$ that optimizes the MSE in a given LPP.
  While   DFA was originated to handle univariate time series, its
 multivariate generalization -- Multivariate Direct Filter Analysis (MDFA) --
 is designed for the broader context of LPPs discussed in Chapter \ref{lpp_chap}.
   
 The entire class of concurrent filters corresponds to 
  the collection of power series in $L$.  Here we are interested in 
 scalar targets given $N$ input series, so the coefficient matrices of the
 concurrent filters are $1 \times n$.  We may be interested in some subcollection
 $\mathcal{G}$ of all concurrent filters.  For instance, $\mathcal{G}$ could
 be the optimal solutions to an LPP for a particular process, i.e., consist of
 all $\widehat{\Psi} (L)$ given in (\ref{eq:GPPsoln}) for a particular $\Psi (L)$ and
 $\Theta (L)$.  Or we might consider much broader classes of filters, that are 
 described in terms of the rate of decay of the filter coefficients, e.g.,
\[
  \mathcal{G} = \{ \Upsilon (L) : \Upsilon (e^{-i \omega}) \;
  \mbox{is twice continuously differentiable at } \; \omega = 0 \}.
\]
  Alternatively, $\mathcal{G}$ might consist of all VARMA filters of a
 particular AR and MA order, or might consist of all Zero-Pole
 Combination (ZPC) filters of a given specification (Wildi, 2008).
 The original univariate DFA of Wildi (2008) approached the LPP with
 $\mathcal{G}$ consisting of appropriately restricted ZPC filters.

  For now, we shall suppose that the concurrent filters of $\mathcal{G}$ belong
 to some parametric family described by a parameter $\vartheta$ belonging to a 
 parameter manifold.  Because we seek elements of $\mathcal{G}$ that will solve
 an LPP, i.e., be a good concurrent approximation to $\Psi (L)$, we use the notation
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:filter-set}
 \mathcal{G} = \{
 \widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta}  (L) : \vartheta \; \mbox{belongs to a
  parameter space} \}.
\end{equation}
  Whereas the model-based 
 approach to the LPP  discussed in Chapter \ref{lpp_chap} 
involves minimizing a particular parametric form of the filter error MSE -- namely
 the function $J_{\Psi} (\vartheta, G)$ for $G$ corresponding either to the
 periodogram or true spectrum -- a more direct approach is
 to  minimize a general expression for the filter error MSE over a given set
 $\mathcal{G}$.    The real-time estimation error is given in (\ref{eq:dfa-error}),
 which has mean zero and variance
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:dfa-mvar}
 \EE [ E_t^2 ]  = { \langle  \left[ \Psi (z) -  \widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta} (z) \right] \, 
  \widetilde{F} \,
  {  \left[ \Psi (z) -  \widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta} (z) \right] }^{*} \rangle }_0.
\end{equation}
  This suggests the criterion function  $D_{\Psi} (\vartheta, G)$ for
 any Hermitian function $G$, defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mdfa-criterion}
 D_{\Psi} (\vartheta, G) = { \langle  \left[ \Psi (z) -  \widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta} (z) \right] \, 
  G \,
  {  \left[ \Psi (z) -  \widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta} (z) \right] }^{*} \rangle }_0.
\end{equation}
 This is the MDFA criterion function.  
 An equivalent formula to (\ref{eq:mdfa-criterion}) that can be useful for calculations is
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:mdfa-alternate}
   D_{\Psi} (\vartheta, G) = \mbox{tr} \{ 
 { \langle G \, M_{\vartheta} \rangle }_0 \} \qquad M_{\vartheta} (z) = 
 {  \left[ \Psi (z) -  \widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta} (z) \right] }^{*} \,
   {  \left[ \Psi (z) -  \widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta} (z) \right] }.
\end{equation}
 Given a filter class $\mathcal{G}$, the
 best possible concurrent filter is  given by
 $\widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta (\widetilde{F})}$,
  where $\vartheta (\widetilde{F})$ is a minimizer of
  $D_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widetilde{F})$.  This
 $\vartheta (\widetilde{F})$ is the
 PTV for the filter parameter, in analogy with the
 terminology for model parameters.  Clearly, if the set $\mathcal{G}$ is rendered
 sufficiently large to include the optimal concurrent filter for that particular
 LPP and process -- as given in Proposition \ref{prop:GPP} -- then there exists
 some $\widetilde{\vartheta}$ such that $\widehat{\Psi}_{\widetilde{\vartheta}}$ 
 is identical with the optimal filter.  However, if $\mathcal{G}$ is smaller,
 then the PTV $\vartheta (\widetilde{F})$ is as close as possible according
 to $D_{\Psi} $ discrepancy to the optimal filter.  

A   case of interest arises from taking the broadest possible $\mathcal{G}$
 for a sample of size $T$.
 Let $\mathcal{G}$ consist of all length $T$ concurrent filters, with 
\[
\vartheta^{\prime}  =  \left[ {\widehat{\psi} (0) }, 
  {\widehat{\psi} (1) }^{}, \ldots,   {\widehat{\psi} (T-1) }^{} \right].
\]
 So $\vartheta$ is a column vector of length $T n$.  Then the 
criterion (\ref{eq:mdfa-criterion})
 can be rewritten as
\[
 D_{\Psi} (\vartheta, G)  = \vartheta^{\prime} \, B \, \vartheta - \vartheta^{\prime} \, b - 
   b^* \, \vartheta + { \langle \Psi (z) \, G \, { \Psi (z) }^* \rangle }_0,
\]
 where 
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:bstar-expression}
  b^*  = \left[ { \langle \Psi (z) \, G \rangle }_{0}, { \langle \Psi (z) \, G \rangle }_{1},
  \ldots, { \langle \Psi (z) \, G \rangle }_{T-1} \right],
\end{equation}
  and $B$ is a block matrix, where the $jk$th $n \times n$ block of  is 
  ${ \langle G \rangle }_{k-j}$.

\begin{Proposition}
\label{prop:mdfa.quadsoln}
 The minimizer of the MDFA criterion (\ref{eq:mdfa-criterion}),
  given that $\mathcal{G}$ consist of all length $T$ concurrent filters,
  is
\[
 \vartheta = B^{-1} \, \Re (b),
\]
 where the $jk$th  block of $B$   is    ${ \langle G \rangle }_{k-j}$,
 and $b$ is given by (\ref{eq:bstar-expression}).
\end{Proposition}

\paragraph{Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:mdfa.quadsoln}.}
 The objective function is a quadratic in $\vartheta$, and therefore
  the minimizer is obtained 
 by computing the gradient and Hessian, whih are 
  $-2 \Re (b) + 2 B \, \vartheta$ and   $2 B$ respectively,
  yielding the solution. $\quad \Box$

\vspace{.5cm}

   This broad class $\mathcal{G}$ of filters
  will furnish concurrent filters that closely approximate those of
 Proposition \ref{prop:GPP} as $ T \tends \infty$.


\paragraph{Example 1: Multi-step Ahead Forecasting}
  Suppose we consider the   one-step ahead forecasting of stationary time series and
 $\mathcal{G} $ corresponds to   all VMA filters of   order $q$, where  
\[
 \vartheta  = \mbox{vec} [{\widehat{\psi} (0) }^{\prime}, {\widehat{\psi} (1) }^{\prime},   \ldots,
  {\widehat{\psi} (q) }^{\prime} ].
\]
 With $\Psi (L) = L^{-1}$ from (\ref{eq:mdfa-criterion}) we
 have 
\begin{align*}
 D_{\Psi} (\vartheta, G) & = 
 { \langle  \left[ z^{-1} e_1^{\prime} -  \widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta} (z) \right] \,   G \,
  {  \left[ z^{-1} e_1^{\prime} -  \widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta} (z) \right] }^{*} \rangle }_0 \\
 & = { \langle  \left[ e_1^{\prime} -  \sum_{\ell = 0}^q \widehat{\psi} (\ell) \, z^{\ell+1} \right] \, 
  G \,   {  \left[ e_1^{\prime} -   \sum_{\ell = 0}^q \widehat{\psi} (\ell) \, z^{\ell+1} \right]
  }^{*} \rangle }_0 \\
 & = { \langle G \rangle }_0 - 2 \, \vartheta^{\prime} \, { \langle G \rangle }_{1:(q+1)} \, e_1
   + \vartheta^{\prime} \, { \langle G \rangle }_{0:q,0:q} \, \vartheta.
\end{align*}
 Hence the  optimizer is 
\[
 \vartheta (G) = { \langle G \rangle }_{0:q,0:q}^{-1} \, 
   { \langle G \rangle }_{1:(q+1)} \, e_1,
\]
 which is the first component of the solution to the Yule-Walker system of order $q+1$ determined by $G$.
  Therefore the MDFA solution is the same as the fit of a VAR($q+1$) using 
 Proposition \ref{prop:GPP}.

\vspace{.5cm}

  The empirical problem is solved by minimizing $D_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widehat{F})$,
 yielding the estimator $\vartheta (\widehat{F})$.  The empirical criterion can be simply 
 computed using (\ref{eq:mdfa-alternate}) and (\ref{eq:acf2per}), namely
\[
   D_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widehat{F}) = \sum_{|h| < T } \mbox{tr} \{ 
   \widehat{\Gamma} (h) \,  { \langle  M_{\vartheta} \rangle }_{-h} \}.
\] 
Filtering with  $\widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta (\widehat{F})}$ instead
 of $\widehat{\Psi}_{\vartheta (\widetilde{F})}$
 involves some statistical error, which vanishes as $n \tends \infty$ because
  $\vartheta (  \widehat{F})$ is consistent for the PTV.  We can quantify this additional 
 error if we know the statistical properties of the estimate; under fairly broad conditions,
 it follows a central limit theorem.  As in Chapter \ref{lpp_chap}, we assume 
  the HT conditions and that   the  Hessian  $H(\vartheta) = \nabla \nabla^{\prime}
  D_{\Psi} (\vartheta, \widetilde{F}) $  of $D_{\Psi} $ is positive definite at the PTV.
  The function $M$ is defined in (\ref{eq:mdfa-alternate}).

\begin{Theorem} 
\label{thm:MDFAasymp}
 Suppose that $\vartheta (\widetilde{f})$ exists uniquely in the
 interior of the filter parameter space, and that
 $H(\vartheta (\widetilde{F}))$ is 
 positive definite.  Suppose that $\{ X_t \}$ has finite fourth moments, 
conditions (HT1)-(HT6) of Taniguchi and Kakizawa (2000, pp.55-56)
 hold, and that the fourth order cumulant function of $\{ X_t \}$ is zero.  
 Then the estimator is consistent for the PTV, and
\[
 \sqrt{T} \, \left( \vartheta( \widehat{F} ) - \vartheta (\widetilde{F}) \right) 
 \convinlaw \mathcal{N} \left( 0, { H(\vartheta (\widetilde{F})) }^{-1} \, V (\vartheta (\widetilde{F})) \, { H(\vartheta (\widetilde{F})) }^{-1} \right)
\]
 as $T \tends \infty$, where 
\[
  V_{jk} (\vartheta) =  \mbox{tr} \{ { \langle  \partial_j M_{\vartheta} (z) \, \widetilde{F} \,
 \partial_k M_{\vartheta} (z) \, \widetilde{F} \rangle }_0 \}.
\]
\end{Theorem}

\paragraph{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:MDFAasymp}.}
  This is proved in the same way as Theorem \ref{thm:LPP-Clt}.

\vspace{.5cm}

  We designate the resulting   prediction function
$\widehat{\Psi}_{\widehat{\vartheta}}$  as  a {\em Linear
Prediction Filter} (LPF). 

\paragraph{Illustration 1: VAR(1).}  Again consider a VAR(1) process,
 and suppose we wish to use MDFA to approximate the optimal LPP
 solution -- even though we don't know the true dynamics.
   Let $\mathcal{G}$ denote the set of moving average filters of
 length $T$, and $G$ is the spectral density of the VAR(1);
  the solution given by Proposition \ref{prop:mdfa.quadsoln}
 can be compared to that of the LPP, which has the first $T$ components
 given by
\[
 \varphi^{\prime} = [ \psi (0) + A_{\Psi} (\Phi), \psi (1),
 \ldots, \psi (T-1)].
\]
 This is an approximate solution to the system $\vartheta^{\prime} \, B
 = \Re b^{\prime}$, because
 $  \varphi^{\prime} \, B $ has $j+1$th component, for $0 \leq j \leq T-1$,
 equal to
\[
   \sum_{\ell=0}^{T-1} \psi (\ell) \, {\langle G \rangle }_{j-\ell}
 + A_{\Psi} (\Phi) \, \Gamma (j).
\]
  Noting that
\[
 A_{\Psi} (\Phi) \, \Gamma (j)
 = \sum_{\ell < 0 } \psi (-\ell) \, \Phi^{-\ell} \, \Gamma (j)
 = \sum_{\ell < 0} \psi (-\ell) \, \Gamma (j- \ell),
\]
 because for a VAR(1) process $\Gamma (h) = \Phi^h \, \Gamma (0)$ when
 $h \geq 0$, we see that component $j+1$ of $\varphi^{\prime} \, B$ is
\[
  \sum_{\ell \leq T-1} \psi (\ell) \, \Gamma (j-\ell)
  =  {[ \Re b^{\prime} ]}_{j+1} - \sum_{\ell \geq T} \psi (\ell) \, \Gamma (j-\ell).
\]
 As $T \tends \infty$ the error term vanishes (for each $j$), indicating
 that $\varphi^{\prime} \, B \approx \Re b^{\prime}$, or
 $\vartheta \approx \varphi$.

\paragraph{Exercise 1: Correct VAR(1) LPP.}  Simulate a sample of size $T=100$ from a
  bivariate VAR(1) process with 
\[
  \Phi = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & .5 \\ -.2 & .3 \end{array} \right]
\]
 and $\Sigma$ equal to the identity.  The eigenvalues are $.8$ and $.5$.
  Implement MDFA for this sample, using the moving average filters
 (Proposition \ref{prop:mdfa.quadsoln}) to approximate the optimal
 LPP solution, for the $2$-step
 ahead forecasting LPP (Example 1) and the ideal low-pass LPP (Example 2)
 with    $\mu = \pi/24$.  Does the MDFA concurrent filter closely
 match the optimal LPP filter?  Repeat for $T=200$ and $T=500$.


\paragraph{Exercise 2: Incorrect VAR(1) LPP.}  Simulate a sample of size
  $T=100$ from  a bivariate  VMA(1) with
\[
 \Theta = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & 0 \\ .4 & 2 \end{array} \right]
\]
  and $\Sigma$ equal to the identity.  Use the moving average filter
 MDFA  (Proposition \ref{prop:mdfa.quadsoln}) to find the best
 concurrent filter, for the $2$-step
 ahead forecasting LPP (Example 1) and the ideal low-pass LPP (Example 2)
 with    $\mu = \pi/24$.  Compare these results to the 
  VAR(1) LPP filter previously obtained, based on the mis-specified
 VAR(1) model.  Which filter, LPP or MDFA, more closely approximates
 the ideal filter?   Repeat for $T=200$ and $T=500$, and explain your results.
